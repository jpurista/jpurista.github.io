				Hey, I'm Juan Pablo Urista. I'm a high school student, a photographer, a La Croix fanatic, and a musician I currently attend Lake Travis High School in Austin, TX where I focus my studies in computer science and business. <br><br>I have participated in several programs, sometimes as the student and other times as the teacher. <br><br>I have attended the BioFORCE Academy at Texas A&amp;M where we explored future applications of bio-pharmaceuticals and toured state of the art labs. <br><br>Additionally, I have worked as a High School Fellow at the NASA FAMA Summer Program, a program targeted towards disadvantaged elementary school students. The program is funded by a NASA grant at Texas State University immerses these students into a week of engineering and math taught through fun experiments and projects.<br><br>I currently attend the Summer Academy for Math and Science at Carnegie Mellon University, the #1 computer science school in the world, where I am studying web development and concepts of mathematics. SAMS is a very selective program with an acceptance rate of 8%.
