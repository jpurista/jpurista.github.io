#### <u>Project Description</u>
This project was completed as a web development project for my Information Systems class. In completing the project, I made a design guide for uniformity throughout the site, created and followed wireframes, and performed user testing for optimized user experience. There were no front-end frameworks used for the layout of the pages as most elements were made with pure HTML and CSS. However, there were some external JQuery and iFrame elements used on the Location and Reviews pages.

#### <u>Project/Technical Goals</u>
  The goal was to redesign the website for Pamela's Dine in order to create an enhanced experience for visitors to:
  - navigate the website
  - search for menu items
  - find information about the different locations
  - link to third-party sites to order food from the menu

#### <u>Looking Ahead</u>

When I look back at web dev projects that I've completed, I always end up finding things that I could improve on. Although I could do the same with this project, I believe it should be left as is to prove that I can complete a quality website with a constrained time-frame.
