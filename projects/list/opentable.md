# Redesigning the Opentable Database


#### <u>Project Timeline</u>
Fall 2022


#### <u>Course</u>
67-262 Database Design & Development



#### <u>Project Description</u>
This project was to be completed as sort of a term project. It was the result of all we had learned throughout the semester. At this point we had learned a lot about database creation, setup, normalization, and manipulation. Given the choice of working with different real-world examples, we chose the Opentable scenario. 



#### <u>Project/Technical Goals</u>
This project was fairly well structured. We had to create several models and perform functions on them. These included:
- Creating the Concepual Model
- Creating th Relational Model
- Identifying Functional Dependencies
- Normalizing the Database
- Creating Physical Model

After creating these models and performing functions to normalize the database, we were tasked with creating queries that were real-life use cases for customers, manager, and database administrators.



#### <u>Final Product & Documentation</u>
All of this can be found in our final documentation here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nIwt4R_JFHaxCow1Gj5cbUGGsy6p7rlYrx2jaedJg6Q/edit" target="_blank">Final Report (Google Docs)</a>

You can find our user stories for our real-life scenarios here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LGz_THipu0mP4BJ9_00ys3d_LjmVDPI5IdrlzItl4i4/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">User Stories (Google Sheets)</a>

You can also find our sample data here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mNMGjpAm9XyNSsOTEFMig0TjsV0lrbDT?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Sample Data (GoogleDrive)</a>

You can find our python scripts with the queries here: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZ7okZCpet3WXIfNgYUuhRFvuR0OFHWp?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Python Scripts (Google Drive)</a>



#### <u>Looking Ahead</u>
Because this was a class project, I would not extend further on this.

Some possible ideas would be to generate more scripts and queries to make it more usable.
This could possibly done by leveraging AI to create the queries based on simple language input.
