# Cafe 23 Dashboard


#### <u>Project Timeline</u>
Spring 2023


#### <u>Course</u>
67-272 Application Design & Development


#### <u>Project Description</u>
Cafe23 is a fictional coffee shop in Pittsburgh, PA with multiple locations. Employees consist of baristas, cashiers, food prep, managers, administrators, and owners. The dashboard for Cafe23 is a website that allows store managers to schedule shifts, generate payroll, and track employee/store performance. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface. The goal of the dashboard is to improve communication and efficiency within the company, and to provide a centralized location for all employee-related information.
There are two main views for the dashboard: the store view and the business overview. The store view allows managers to schedule shifts, track employee performance, and generate payroll. The business overview allows owners and administrators to view performance metrics for all stores, track sales, and generate reports.


#### <u>Project/Technical Goals</u>
The goals of the dashboard were to communicate a high amount of data in a compact and user-friendly way, to provide a manager, owner, or administrator with all the information they need to make decisions, and to improve communication and efficiency within the company.
- Follow HCI principles to design a user-friendly and intuitive interface
- Use Figma to create wireframes and interactive prototypes
- Gather user feedback and iterate on designs


#### <u>Final Product & Documentation</u>
The final product is a set of hi-fidelity wireframes for the Cafe23 dashboard. The wireframes include the store view and business overview. The wireframes are designed to be responsive and accessible, with a clean and modern interface. The wireframes are based on the low-fidelity wireframes created in the first half of the project, and incorporate feedback from user testing. The wireframes are designed to be implemented into a functional web application.

#### <u>Looking Ahead</u>
Because this was a class project, I would not extend further on this.

The next steps would include implementing this into a functional web application based on the hi-fidelity wireframes. This would involve creating a database to store employee information, shift schedules, and performance metrics, and building a web applicatio to display this information. Other projects in this course have been completed using Ruby on Rails. The web application would be designed to be responsive and accessible, and would include features such as user authentication, data visualization, and interactive elements. The web application would be tested for usability and accessibility, and would be iterated on based on user feedback. The final product would be deployed to a web server and maintained by the Cafe23 company.
