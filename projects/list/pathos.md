### <u>Project Description</u>
Pathos was created as a concept for my media class.
- an AI that you can talk to whenever you need to vent or a shoulder to cry on
- trained with crisis hotline scripts as well as other scripts & phrases that are widely used by Psychiatrists, Psychologists, and Counselors
- The AI has two modes:
  - Crisis Mode is meant to serve as an alternative to support individuals who would benefit from using the National Suicide Prevention Online Chat. The user would be able to have a mostly normal or natural conversation with the AI
  - Scheduled Mode is meant for users to have someone to regularly talk to. The AI would be there to mostly listen to one's story and feelings while providing some response (this will not give a recommendation of treatment)

There is also a physical embodiment of the AI
- The physical machine takes full advantage of the AI to create a safe, calm, and trusting environment
- The machine is meant to be placed in a semi-private communal setting such as study room in a university or quiet pod in the workplace

### <u>Project/Technical Goals</u>
The goals of my project include:
- investigate other empathy projects as a precedent for our projects
- understand empathy and how we can implement it in our surroundings
- create a concept model of a project that recognizes emotion as an input and responds appropriately

### <u>Looking Ahead</u>
At the end of a project I like to look back and reflect on how I can improve on things in the future.
The single biggest thing in making this concept a reality is knowledge. I have minimal knowledge of AI, HCI, prototyping, and creating an overall good user-experience.

To gain knowledge and skills in these areas, I believe I could benefit from class at Carnegie Mellon University, like:
- Human-Machine Virtuosity
- Gadgets, Sensors, and Activity Recognition in HCI
- Rapid Prototyping Technologies
- Other CS courses in AI/ML
