#### <u>Project/Technical Goals</u>
The goals of my project include:
- create a website that supports light to medium traffic
- accept orders online through an order form
- register with all necessary authorities as a non-profit
- implement marketing strategies through social medias such as instagram
- receive feedback from mentors and community members for support and feedback

#### <u>Final Product & Documentation</u>
The final project for this project is the website: <a href='https://growafriend.co' target='_blank' style='text-decoration: none;'>growafriend.co</a>

An additional final product would consist of the plant kit that can be ordered from the website. The plant kit is seeing constant improvement as we recieve additional funding and feedback from the community.

#### <u>Looking Ahead</u>
I hope to grow the non-profit in the future as I attend college to reach more students and young adults. The goal is to restart the project and get the website up and running. I want to improve the packaging and quality of the plant kits that are sent out.
