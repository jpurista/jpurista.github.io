#### <u>Project Description</u>
As part of the class, we worked on a consulting project in conjunction with a local organization. The Filipino-American Association of Pittsburgh needed a website and content redesign. I worked in a group of three to:
- create lo-fi wireframes
- user test
- update wireframes to hi-fi
- implement wireframes using bootstrap



#### <u>Project/Technical Goals</u>
The goal of the redesigned site was to simplify the user experience of the FAAP website for each of our target user groups. This helps prospective members easily access information about the organization’s mission and background, current members quickly find upcoming events, and donors find reasons to donate as well as conveniently find the link to donate.  

One of the objectives of this project was to make the information personal and the design appealing to the users. The secondary objective was to redesign the website so that users can connect with the organization more easily.

We accomplished this by implementing a clear drop-down navigation bar, highlighting the donation links, and making the information more visually compelling rather than text heavy.



#### <u>Final Product & Documentation</u>
The final project source files and documentation can be found on GitHub and Google Drive.

#### <u>Looking Ahead</u>
Moving forward, the main features to implement would be the member portal and
ecommerce website. These are both features that we discussed with the client but didn’t
have the time to ideate on due to the scope of the project. We included icons in the
navigation bar that would link to both of those features once implemented, so the design
already accounts for the addition of these aspects. Additionally, ensuring the backend for
the contact form on the website is set up is another important next step to take so they
can store all the data.
