# <u>Learning About UI/UX Design</u>

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Timeline</span>
- Summer 2022
- Introduction to UI and UX Design (Codecademy)</a>

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Description</span>
Over the length of the course, we covered all basic aspects of UI and UX design like key methodologies and the career landscape. 

We also learned about the wireframing process and produced mock wireframes for an outdoor clothing company. You can find my wireframes in my Google Docs notes below.

We went deeper into the world of wireframes and prototyping through Figma.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
My goal was to complete the online course to better prepare myself for the future:
- better prepared for web development and design classes
- qualified to apply for design internships
- have more experience to add more personal projects to my portfolio

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Final Product</span>
Upon completing the course, I received a certificate that can go on my resume and LinkedIn. You can find my codecademy certificate linked <a href='https://www.codecademy.com/profiles/juanpabu/certificates/4ccef8d532484ea2aeec3b3b3dbb4f9c' target='_blank'>here</a>.

I also wrote all of my notes on a google doc which you can find <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/13AzXd28bmlXk4YrOIg2gbbF8DeBlCs_NAyPPtKeTn4k/edit?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>here</a>.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Looking Ahead</span>
I believe that earning this UI/UX design certificate can open up a whole new world of opporunities to grow in my design abilities. I plan on applying to more internships that are geared towards human-centered design like front-end development.
