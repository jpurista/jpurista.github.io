# <u>Simmr App Design</u>


#### <span class="highlight-blue">Timeline</span>
- Spring 2022


#### <span class="highlight-blue">Description</span>
Simmr is an application that connects you with loved ones through cooking. No matter where you are, you can spend time with loved ones doing something so simple yet so meaningful, cooking dinner. Food brings people together at parties, restaurants or even the drive thru line -- why shuoldn't people be able to connect from afar.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Tech Used</span>
- Figma
- Google Slides


#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
The main goal of this project was to create an extremely easy to use mobile application that integrates recipe-finding, message coordination, video chat, and synced instructions. By making each step as simple and intuitive as possible, we are eliminating barriers for users to use the application. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include a splash page to help market the mobile application and direct users to download it to their mobile devices. Ideally, the application would further be developed to function as a web application on laptops.


#### <span class="highlight-blue">Final Product</span>
There are two primary final products.

The first is the splash page. This is relatively simple and makes use of a responsive format, changing the layout as the screen width changes. Desktop makes use of the wide real estate available and displays a large image with the simple tagline "Cook with Simmr". The Mobile version plays into its vertical form factor -- still filling up the page with the image and tagline. Next the users are presented with benefits of using the applicatoin and finally a call to action -- download the mobile app or launch on desktop.

The next deliverable was the mobile application. This is much more comprehensive and first asks the user to create an account or login via one of many social account logins (Google, Apple, Facebook). The user is then presented with the recipes page where they can browse recipes, see ingredients needed, and read the directions. From here, the user can also start a session or send it to a friend. The use can also navigate to the friends page where they can message friends or add new ones. Once two or more friends join a cooking session, they can see video transmission of each other, a recipe summary, ingredients, and the current step in the directions.

The presentation is a simple overview of the mobile app. The presentation outlines information architecture, graphic design choices (such as color/font/icons), and wireframe overview.
The first Figma link is for the Simmr mobile app wireframes.
The second Figma link is for the Simmr splash page wireframes.
