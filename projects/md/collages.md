# <u>Collated Collages</u>

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Timeline</span>
- Fall 2021
- Course: 62150 - Introduction to Mediascapes: 2D to 3D Spatial Environments

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Description</span>
As part of a course, we were asked to create collages that begin to explore the idea of a heterotopia. Something that is otherwordly or in-between. Somewhere between life and death, like a cemetery. Somewhere that's so isolated, but we choose to explore it: space. Or even the connection we see between an artist and their artwork.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Tech Used</span>
- Photoshop
- Google Slides

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
Create something that is beautiful to me and conveys the idea of a heterotopia or altered state or connection point. Bonus points if it's aesthetically pleasing.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Final Product</span>
My collages can all be found on my google drive.

The first collage is one I'm particularly proud of (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VZ7TbNQUO3iBf1XKqazqceZ1K7L__vJv/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>). I just feel like I can really connect with it and I think it looks nice :)

The second collage is one that makes a bit less sense. It explores the connection between Diego Rivera and Takashi Murakami (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14wM-zv9QBjoo8MNvvclPjFqOlVerYabV/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>).

The penultimate collage is a collaboration with my friend Maddy. We combined our collages to creatae a mega one! It is a combination of Fairey, Rivera, Murakami, and Haring (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/14IawYVy974-BzAZ4PqYnATi38Y5xba_Q/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">here</a>)

The final collage I made has nothing to do with the previous ones. It is a collage of me and what I enjoy and what I thought were some of my building blockas at the time. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hbV9Rhzx1UNRSfHkEvLatHP6Lzzs7Ugb/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Here</a> it is.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Looking Ahead</span>
I would love to continue making collages, I think they're a great way for me to express myself and explore new ideas.
