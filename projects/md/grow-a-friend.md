# <u>Grow A Friend</u>

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Timeline</span>
- 2020 to 2021

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Description</span>
About the non-profit:
- started when the COVID-19 pandemic began and classes were cancelled
- a non-profit organization that aims to help create a space for the community to promote mental wellness with plants
- goal is to encourage everyone to grow their own little friend at home as it helps instill a sense of joy, patience, responsibility, purpose, and reverence for all aspects of life

Support and Audience in Numbers:
- over 250 plant kits and notes delivered to students and individuals
- 6 states reached
- over 1000 unique website users

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Tech Used</span>
- HTML/CSS/JS
- Bootstrap
- Google Sheets with Scripts

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
The goals of my project include:
- create a website that supports light to medium traffic
- accept orders online through an order form
- register with all necessary authorities as a non-profit
- implement marketing strategies through social medias such as instagram
- receive feedback from mentors and community members for support and feedback

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Final Product</span>
The final project for this project is the website: <a href='https://growafriend.co' target='_blank' style='text-decoration: none;'>growafriend.co</a>

An additional final product would consist of the plant kit that can be ordered from the website. The plant kit is seeing constant improvement as we recieve additional funding and feedback from the community.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Looking Ahead</span>
I hope to grow the non-profit in the future as I attend college to reach more students and young adults. The goal is to restart the project and get the website up and running. I want to improve the packaging and quality of the plant kits that are sent out.
