#### <span class="highlight-blue">Description</span>
Furious Fowl was completed as my term project.
This game is called 'Furious Fowl'! It is inspired by the famous 'Angry Birds'.
- In the game, you launch birds at the green pigs in an attempt to defeat them all
- As the pigs are hit, they are removed from the game
- Once you hit all the pigs in a level, new pigs will fall from the sky onto platforms, taking you to the next level
- When you complete the four levels, you will be asked to input a username which will be displayed on the scoreboard

Apart from playing the four pre-built levels, you can build your own levels by following the menu
- The games are stored in a directory with all levels built by all users
- To access a level you built in a previous session, you follow the menu to the 'open' screen where you will enter the filename

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Tech Used</span>
- Python
- TKinter Graphics Package

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
The technical goals of my project include:
- organized file and image system
- fairly realistic projectile-structure interactions
- basic gameplay features
- auto-updating scoreboard
- level editor

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Looking Ahead</span>
At the end of a project I like to look back and reflect on how I can improve on things in the future.

In this instance, I think one of the biggest factors in improving on this game is time. The game had a beginning-to-end timeline of about one month. With just a bit more time I believe I could improve the efficiency of the game while including game features that I wasn't able to inlclude in v1.

Apart from time, I believe I could benefit from more education in creating a solid UI/UX and writing a storyline for a game and including that in the actual gameplay.
