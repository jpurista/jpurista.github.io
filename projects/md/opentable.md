# <u>Redesigning the Opentable Database</u>


#### <span class="highlight-blue">Timeline</span>
- Fall 2022
- Course: 67-262 Database Design & Development

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Description</span>
This project was to be completed as sort of a term project. It was the result of all we had learned throughout the semester. At this point we had learned a lot about database creation, setup, normalization, and manipulation. Given the choice of working with different real-world examples, we chose the Opentable scenario.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Tech Used</span>
- SQL
- Python
- Vertabelo

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
This project was fairly well structured. We had to create several models and perform functions on them. These included:
- Creating the Concepual Model
- Creating th Relational Model
- Identifying Functional Dependencies
- Normalizing the Database
- Creating Physical Model

After creating these models and normalizing the database, we were tasked with creating queries for real-life use cases for customers, managers, and database administrators.

Our work is documented in the following resources:

- Sample Data: <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mNMGjpAm9XyNSsOTEFMig0TjsV0lrbDT?usp=sharing" target="_blank">GoogleDrive</a>
- Python Scripts (Contains queries): <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XZ7okZCpet3WXIfNgYUuhRFvuR0OFHWp?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Drive</a>


#### <span class="highlight-blue">Looking Ahead</span>
Because this was a class project, I would not extend further on this.

While this was a class project and not intended for further development, potential extensions could include:
- Generating more scripts and queries to enhance usability
- Leveraging AI to create queries based on simple language input
