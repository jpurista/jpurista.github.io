#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Description </span>
Cafe23 is a fictional coffee shop in Pittsburgh, PA with multiple locations. The dashboard for Cafe23 is a website that allows store managers to schedule shifts, generate payroll, and track employee/store performance. The dashboard is designed to be user-friendly and intuitive, with a clean and modern interface. The goal is to improve communication and efficiency within the company, and to provide a centralized location for all employee-related information.

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Tech Used </span>
- Figma

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Goals </span>
Follow HCI principles to design a user-friendly and intuitive interface
Use Figma to create wireframes and interactive prototypes
Gather user feedback and iterate on designs
Communicate a high amount of data in a compact and user-friendly way
Provide managers, owners, and administrators with all the information they need to make decisions
Improve communication and efficiency within the company

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Final Product </span>
The final product is a set of hi-fidelity wireframes for the Cafe23 dashboard, including the store view and business overview. The wireframes are designed to be responsive and accessible, with a clean and modern interface. They incorporate feedback from user testing and are designed to be implemented into a functional web application.

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Looking Ahead </span>
As this was a class project, it won't be extended further. However, the next steps would typically include implementing the design into a functional web application based on the hi-fidelity wireframes. This would involve creating a database, building a web application using Ruby on Rails, implementing user authentication, data visualization, and interactive elements. The application would then be tested for usability and accessibility, iterated based on user feedback, and finally deployed to a web server.
