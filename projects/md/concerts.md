# <u>Creating Concert Tickets</u>

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Timeline </span>
- Fall 2024

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Description </span>
I have fond memories of going to hockey games with my dad as a child. My parents were never big on buying souvenirs for every single event we attended, so the one thing I could count on was my ticket. I still keep and cherish a hockey ticket from a Detroit Red Wings game that took place about 15 years ago. This year, I've saved up my money and bought tickets for about 4 concerts of artists that I truly love. Instead of spending hundreds of dollars to get concert merch, I decided to create my very own concert tickets that even have my seat number on them!

#### <span class="highlight-blue"> Tech Used </span>
- Figma

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Goals</span>
Create 4 distinct concert tickets that I can keep as a souvenir from attending Childish Gambino, Rex Orange County, Billie Eilish, and Kacey Musgraves. I want to make sure each ticket showcases something unique about the artist, album, or tour. This can come in the form of font, color, small details/artifacts, and overall composition.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Final Product</span>
My final product came in the form of a Figma project. Each ticket follows the same layout of an area that displays the seat location and a much larger area that holds the artists picture, title, and rest of the design. As I began this project, I kind of realized there is only so much that can be done with font weight/size and color so I felt it would be more personalized if there was a picture of each artist. Specifically, I searched for images that have been used as press for their current tour or album release. I also took inspiration from the artist's current merch for the colors used. For Childish Gambino, there is the signature rainbow, which can be found on tour posters and start to resemble the amazin lightwork and lasers he used on tour. For Billie Eilish, much of the inspiration was taken from her tour posters with an added flair of a blue latex background. Although it is difficult to see, the background image on the Rex Orange County ticket is a manila file folder that has a subtle texture and the text has a color pattern similar to his tiger's eye vinyl currently on sale. Finally, the Kacey Musgraves ticket takes inspiration from tour media and her music. I feel that her search for meaning and serenity are well portrayed through nature just as she has on her posters.

#### <span class="highlight-blue">Looking Ahead</span>
I think it would be cool to do this for all future concerts I go to. I think apart from having a cool souvenir, it helps me connect with the artist's music and their intentions for the album and tour.
